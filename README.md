## Machine learning algorithms for the classification of object surface structure using reflected ultrasonic signals

  

**This thesis will study how FFT data from ultrasonic sensors may be utilised to train a neural network for object categorisation. The purpose of this investigation is to better understand how FFT data can be employed. When more sources of object classification are added to the active safety systems of a vehicle, it becomes possible to cross-verify the classifications generated by other sensors that are installed on the vehicle. The majority of the time that ultrasonics  are utilised is during low-speed movement, such as during parking    sequences. They are positioned in strategic regions to collect data from the near surrounds of the car, both in the front and in the back. The results of this study will contribute to a greater knowledge of the opportunities for research and applications on a wide scale after they have been compiled.**
